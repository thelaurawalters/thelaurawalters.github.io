				<div class="container">
					<p>In October some of the ladies from TheTin went to the Women of Silicon Roundabout event in Kings Cross. We heard from some fantastic speakers and were inspired by the strides women have been making in the industry. On the flip side we were also a little daunted by the progress that clearly still needs to be made. These are our key takeaways from the event.</p>
					<p>There were conversations, presentations and panel discussions from Suzanne Timmons and Bjorn Bringert (Google), Melissa Di Donato (Salesforce), Naomi Gwendolyn Smit (Digital McKinsey) and Faz Aftab (ITV) etc. Throughout the event there were a few points that were repeatedly raised: unconscious bias, the importance of mentoring and sponsorship, the lack of role models and that equality in the workplace is not just the right thing to do - it’s also good for business.</p>

				<h2>Web and digital</h2>
				<p>I have designed websites and digital content for a wide range of clients, from a global consulting firm, a workplace healthcare company, and many others. As well as specialising in user interface (UI) design, I have focused on responsiveness, usability, accessibility and user experience (UX).</p>
